To run the code, you need to download all the files and store them in a folder and use 'cd' on the command line to go to that folder. Then you need to install all the packages we used in the 'app_full.py' file if you don't have them. Then simply run '$ python app_full.py' which will start a local server on your computer and open the link 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' using your browser, you should be able to navigate the application.
